# HTTPS Handshake

This is me exploring the components of a HTTPS Handshake.

This is NOT an implementation of TLS that should be expected to be fully compliant (will likely only support a few hardcoded Algorithms) or able to provide data past the Handshake.

Currently it supports
- ClientHello
- ServerHello (Kind of)

Next Steps would be Certificate Generation/Storage, as HTTPS requires a Certificate to be shared immediately after ServerHello.

ServerHello I am also not completely confident with, as Extensions are poorly documented online, so I do not know what Extensions are needed in this Modern Web.

## Notes

Python is a really bad language to implement a data-oriented system.

HelloRequest is conceptually something that happens before ClientHello, but doesn't seem to be part of the Handshake?
